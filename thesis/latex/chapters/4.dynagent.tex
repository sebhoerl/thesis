\chapter{Dynamic Agents in MATSim}
\label{sec:dynagent}


- Do concise testing:

  FSM implementation vs. DVRP

  - really favorable utility, so that a lot of AVs are chosen
  - FIFO Dispatching
  - Density-based distribution

  - Simulate with different AV fleet sizes, so that saturation is reached

  - theoretical investigation
    - try to fit the theoretical results with the measurement
    - do extrapolation
    - find "critical point"

  - show linear increase with unused dvrp



  - describe AgentLock approach vs. DVRP

  - show FSM functionality
