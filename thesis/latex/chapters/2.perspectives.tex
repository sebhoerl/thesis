\chapter{Perspectives on autonomous vehicles}

When it comes to the implementation of autonomous vehicles a lot of technological
questions need to be answered, ranging from high-performance image processing
to fail-safe and secure artificial intelligence. On the other side the adaption
of autonomous vehicles will be highly influenced by encouragement through the
authorities, companies willing to provide the services and finally the customer,
who needs to decide whether he is wanting to pay the money for a ride and is
comfortable enough with the technology to start using autonomous vehicles.

The following chapters will give an overview about different views on AV technology
and how they should be regarded when simulating autonomous taxis in an urban
environment.
